**General description**
-
This open course will guide participants through the discovery, use and reuse of open educational resources (OER) for teaching purposes in all sectors of education. Together we will explore approaches to selecting and using materials that have been created by others, unpack the process of adaptation and discuss sharing and networking. This course will be highly attractive to both those who want to start using OER in their teaching and those who are already users but who are looking for an opportunity to create and share their own teaching resources for teaching.

**Learning outcomes**
-
 - Awareness of benefits and disadvantages of using OER
 - Ability to search, discover and evaluate OER
 - Understanding of the process of adapting and reusing OER for teaching

**What is expected of participants?**
-
The course has a duration of **four weeks**. You are expected to spend approximately **3 hours per week** working through the content and doing the different activities, **supported by a course facilitator**. Every week you will have the chance to **earn a badge**; at the end of the course, after reflecting openly on your experience, you can apply to be awarded The ExplOERer! badge.

You are also invited to take part in a series of four **webinars** where experts in the field, experienced educators and panelists will discuss the week's topics and answer your questions.

You can take the course on your own, participating in the conversations and weekly webinars, but you are also encouraged to **step outside online boundaries**: bring your reflections to your own workplace, do the course with a colleague and together share practices face-to-face.
