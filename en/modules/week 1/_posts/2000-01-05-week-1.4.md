[Understanding Open Educational Resources][1], by the Commonwealth of Learning, is a wonderful resource that will tell you probably everything you need to know about OER. Check Sections 1.1 to 1.5 in relation to what we've been discussing here this week.

Open educators [Catherine Cronin][2] and [Viv Rolfe][3] have recently launched the [GoOpen][4] wiki "to share resources and approaches with anyone wishing to explore open education". You are invited to have a look and of course, contribute to it.

If you are interested in more academic reading, Tita Beaven writes about how three language teachers engage with OER in [OER (re)use and language teachersâ€™ tacit professional knowledge: three vignettes][5].

For the latest research on OER and open education, we suggest you follow IRRODL, [The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning][6], and also [Open Praxis][7], published by the International Council for Open and Distance Education (ICDE).

If there are any particular resources that you have come across and found useful, share a link in the forum and explain why.
