title: 3.3 About ownership
---

In his blog post [It's not reuse, it's adaptation][1] Martin Weller reflects on the concept of reuse and what adaptation means for different people. 

He writes: 

*"So why is there this discrepancy between our findings [indicating high levels of adaptation] and the commonly reported dearth of reuse? Maybe it’s semantics? Reuse is perhaps a very OER specific way of putting it, and people aren’t sure if what they’ve done counts as reuse. Or maybe reuse sounds cheap, like stealing, whereas adapting has connotations of improving, taking ownership of, being active."*
