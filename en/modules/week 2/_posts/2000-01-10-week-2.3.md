title: 2.3 Your OER places
---

Although research tells us that open content is hard to find, there is a growing number of repositories and search engines to help you locate what you need.

Here are some suggestions:

 - [OER Commons][1] contains 50,000 learning materials in a variety of
   subjects ranging from preschool to adult education
 - [OpenLearn][2] is the home of free learning materials from The Open
   University
 - [OpenStax CNX][3] offers thousands of textbook-style resources in a
   host of disciplines that can be viewed, downloaded, adapted and
   shared
 - [PhET][4] is a collection of free interactive simulations for Math
   and Science from the University of Colorado
 - For language learning materials, head over to the [Center for Open
   Educational Resources and Language Learning][5] at the University of
   Texas
 - [iBerry The Academic Porthole][6] helps you connect to information
   and resources in Higher Education

If you are looking for images, [Photos for Class][7] allows you to directly search properly attributed, Creative Commons, age-appropriate images from Flickr;
[Unsplash][8] contains photos licensed [Creative Commons Zero][9], and [Pixabay][10] gives you access to hundreds of thousands of public domain images, including vectors and art illustrations.
