title: 2.4 An OER rubric
---

Once you find an openly-licensed resource (an image, a lesson, a unit, etc.), how do you decide whether you are going to use it in class or not? 

The questions below, adapted from [Achieve][1], suggest some aspects you may want to consider when evaluating the quality of teaching and learning resources. 

**Quality of explanation of the subject matter**
 
 - How thoroughly is the subject matter explained?

 - Are the main ideas clearly identified for the students?

**Utility of materials designed to support teaching**
 
 - Are materials comprehensive and easy to understand and use?

 - Are suggestions for ways to use the materials with a variety of
   learners included?

**Quality of technological interactivity**

 - If interactive, is this feature purposeful and directly related to
   learning?

 - If interactive, do materials create an individualised learning
   experience (i.e. do they adapt to students based on what they do?)

**Opportunities for deeper learning**

 - Do materials engage students in working collaboratively, thinking
   critically and solving complex problems, learning how to learn,
   communicating effectively, etc.?

**Assurance of accessibility**

 - Are the materials fully accessible for ALL students, i.e. visually
   impaired, print disabled, etc.?
