[Understanding Open Educational Resources][1], by the Commonwealth of Learning, is a wonderful resource that will tell you probably everything you need to know about OER. Check Sections 1.1 to 1.5 in relation to what we've been discussing here this week.

Open educators [Catherine Cronin][2] and [Viv Rolfe][3] have recently launched the [GoOpen][4] wiki "to share resources and approaches with anyone wishing to explore open education". You are invited to have a look and of course, contribute to it.

If there are any particular resources that you have come across and found useful, share a link in the forum below.
