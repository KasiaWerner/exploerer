title: "1.3 OER: good or bad?"
---

Of course, it all sounds great on paper but you may be asking yourself  'What is it like in real life? Is there an ugly side to OER?'. That is what we invite you to explore next. 

[Open Washington][1] have written a module about [Why OER matters][2] in which they discuss the benefits and challenges in using OER. Their website also includes a series of links to presentations from faculty who already have experience of using open content; find some of those here for ease of access.  

 - [The Road Ahead - Open Educational Resources - Touting the Benefits
   while Recognizing the Challenges][3] by Pat Pickering
 - [Open Educational Resources: Should I Use them?][4] by Leo Hopcroft
 - [Pros and Cons of OER][5] by Barbara Jacobs

After consulting the above links, think of your own experience at work and make your own list of advantages and disadvantages to using OER. Do you align yourself with the pros or the cons? Why? Post your comment in the forum below.
