[draft version]
So you are teaching new material, how do you go about it?  Do you search the school library? Do you go online? Reflect and take notes.

[need to insert video of teacher, me? talking about how they search for stuff online]

Watch the video.
Have a look at your notes, are your experiences similar to mine? Write in the forum.
