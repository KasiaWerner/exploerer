**General description**

This open course will guide participants through the discovery, use and reuse of open educational resources (OER) for teaching purposes in all sectors of education. Together we will explore approaches to selecting and using materials that have been created by others, unpack the process of adaptation and discuss sharing and networking. This course will be highly attractive to both those who want to start using OER in their teaching and those who are already users but who are looking for an opportunity to create and share their own teaching resources for teaching.

**Learning outcomes**

 - Awareness of benefits and disadvantages of using OER
 - Ability to search, discover and evaluate OER
 - Understanding of the process of adapting and reusing OER for teaching

You can take the course on your own, participating in the conversations and weekly webinars, but you are also encouraged to step outside online boundaries: bring your reflections to your own workplace, do the course with a colleague and together share practices face-to-face.

The course has a duration of four weeks. You are expected to spend approximately 3 hours per week working through the content and doing the different activities. Every week you will have the chance to complete an activity and earn a badge; at the end of the course, after reflecting openly on your experience, you will be awarded The ExplOERer! badge.

This is a course about reuse so in putting it together we have purposely reused as much content as possible, provided it was released under a Creative Commons license allowing adaptation, of course! All sources have been clearly identified and appropriately attributed.

This course is part of the ExplOERer Project, co-funded by the European Commission under the Erasmus+ programme to promote OER sustainability through OER adoption and re-use in professional practice. To learn more about us, head over to http://www.exploerer.gu.se
