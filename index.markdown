**General description**

Duration: 4 weeks x 3 hours = 12 hours 

Target audience: teachers in primary, secondary, HE and private sectors across Europe.

**Short description**

This open course will guide participants through the discovery, use and reuse of OER for teaching purposes in all sectors of education.  It will lead up to and include the creation of one OER and discussions about sharing. ExplOERer will explore inspiring approaches to select and use materials that have been created by others. This course will be highly attractive to both those who want to start using OER in their teaching and those who are already users but who are looking for an opportunity to create and share their own teaching resources for online teaching?

**Learning outcomes**

 - Awareness of benefits of OER
 - Ability to search, discover and evaluate OERs
 - Ability to adapt and reuse OERs for teaching

You can do this on your own, and take part in the conversations every week, but donâ€™t just interact online, make the most of it and bring your reflections to the workplace, do the course with a work colleague.

Every week you will have the chance to complete an activity and earn a badge; at the end of the course, you will have the chance to apply for the ExplOERer badge.

It should take you around 3 hours each week to work through the content and do the activities, including applying for a badge.

This is a course about reuse so we have reused as much content as possible: thanks to Clint Lalonde, Alan Levine, David Wiley, Martin Weller, Paul Stacey and countless others without whose generosity this course would not have been possible. Sources identified as we go along.

There might be a webinar with an expert every week.

These are your course facilitators.
